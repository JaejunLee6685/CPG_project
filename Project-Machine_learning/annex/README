1. single_feature_training.py

-> use can choose single feature when submitting sbatch jobs
-> not only PPI single features (like average shortest distance, jaccard similiarity, )

Here is the example of how to submit job
# distanceAll_path
sbatch -o {log_output_dir} -e {error_output_dir} -J {job_Name} -c 64 --mem=64G -t360 --wrap "python ./002.script/run_RF_single_feature_PPI.py distanceAll_path"

# c: number of core / 64 cores takes maximum 1 hour 30 minutes
# mem: size of memory / 64 Gb recommends
# t: time of running / maximum 1440 mins / scale minutes
# --wrap: command for python

######## python command ########

For single feature:

"python {dir}/{script.py} {Feature_single}"
# feature_name: "case_con_zvalues" (for example)


multiple feature from PPI: # here only consider double

"python {dir}/{script.py} {Feature_single} {Feature_double}" 
# feature_name: "case_con_zvalues" (for example)

2. train_composition_change.py

-> use positive set training composition
-> this is not to use 100% of positive set for machine learning set

## machine learning set
-> machine learning set means the selection of genes before training/test set
-> unbalanced positive(CPG) and negative(Other) set cause biased model construction
-> so, based on the positive set, the user should make as the same number of negative set / this selection step defined machine learnig set selection

After machine learning set selection, now the user can split traing/test set with 8:2 (well established proportion with training and test set)


For selection_portion:
"python {dir}/{script.py} {proportion} "
# proprotion: 0.1 to 1.0 (float)
